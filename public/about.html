<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from Southeast Idaho. My husband and I have been married for 5 years, and we have two beautiful little girls: Amelia, age 2, and Lucy, 8 months. My husband is a Software Developer, which gives me the opportunity to stay home with our children. We currently reside in Texas.</p>

<p>I have a background in Education. My bachelor's is in Elementary Education. I taught school for two years before Amelia was born. I later received my chef certificate through an online program. I've always loved math and problem solving. After working in his career for 6 months, my husband told me I would be good at programming so I finally decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy cooking and baking, making new crochet projects, playing with and teaching my children, reading, puzzles, hiking, and being with my husband.</p>
