<h1>Crystal's Favorite Movies and/or TV Shows</h1>
<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Ramona and Beezus</h3>
<p>I am a mom with two young kids, so this movie speaks to my heart. It is about a 9 year old girl who always seems to be misunderstood. She has a wild imagination and is always pretending and making up words. Her teacher at school sees it as causing trouble, her parents see her as a little wild, and really she is just misunderstood, and is being a kid. As the movie progresses she learns how to help out and when it's okay to be silly and fun. Her dad learns how to understand her, she gains friends and strengthens her relationships with her peers, teacher, and family members. It's a great movie for someone with a tender heart, and crazy kids like me.

<h3>Monk</h3>
<p>Monk is a classic homicide detective movie. It has a good mix of humor, crime, and relatable characters. Monk is an OCD detective who is extremely good at what he does. He has many quirks that make him unlikeable, but you can't help but to fall in love with his character. The show takes place over 8 seasons, and as the seasons progress Monk's character becomes more fun, and you get to see just how great he is at his job. He's the best one out there, really!</p>

<h3>The Great British Baking Show</h3>
<p>This one is great for anyone who loves to bake, and for anyone married to someone who loves to bake. My husband and I watch this one together. It's fun to watch the baked creations people make, and be the judges as we watch each new episode. It gives us cravings for something sweet, we learn a lot, and it's a lot of fun. My favorite things about the show are these:<br />
1. It's family friendly and clean.<br />
2. The contestants are kind to each other. It's not so competitive that everyone says rude things about other contestants.<br />
3. The hosts of the show add a little bit of humor to keep it light. The judges are knowledgable about baking, so the judging is really fair.<br />
